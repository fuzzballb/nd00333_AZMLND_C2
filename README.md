# Delopying and exposing an AzureML auto trained model as a REST endpoint

In this project we used AzureML to train a model based on marketing data from a bank. We chose the optimal model to be deployed as a REST endpoint, and used different methods to consume the endpoint

## Architectural Diagram
*TODO*: Provide an architectual diagram of the project and give an introduction of each step. An architectural diagram is an image that helps visualize the flow of operations from start to finish. In this case, it has to be related to the completed project, with its various stages that are critical to the overall flow. For example, one stage for managing models could be "using Automated ML to determine the best model".

## Key Steps
*TODO*: Write a short discription of the key steps. Remeber to include all the screenshots required to demonstrate key steps.
